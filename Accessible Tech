Accessible technology, often referred to as assistive technology, aims to provide solutions that enable individuals with disabilities to access and use digital devices, software, and online content. These technologies are designed to eliminate 
barriers and enhance the independence and inclusivity of people with diverse abilities. Here are some examples of accessible technology :
