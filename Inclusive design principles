Inclusive design, also known as universal design or design for all, is an approach to designing products, environments, and systems that consider the diverse needs and abilities of all users. The goal is to create designs that are accessible and 
usable by the broadest range of people, regardless of age, ability, or other characteristics, Here are some key principles of inclusive design : 

1. Diverse representation -
Consider the spectrum of diversity - ensure that the design process considers a wide range of abilities, ages, ethnicities, genders, and other characteristics to address the diverse needs of users.

2. User-centered design -
Involve users : engage diverse users in the design process, seeking their input and feedback throughout the development lifecycle. 
User testing : Conduct usability testing with a diverse group of users to identify and address potential barriers.
